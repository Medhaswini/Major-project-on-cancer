        <p style="color:green;">
            Cancer is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Normally, human cells grow and multiply to form new cells as the body needs them.When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t.These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors. Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do.

        <p style="color:green;">
            When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. The findings that result depend on cancer's type and location.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Few symptoms are specific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a "great imitator."
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.
        </p>
        <b>
            <h3>
                <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3>Local Symptoms
            </h3>
        </b>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood (lung cancer), anemia or rectal bleeding (colon cancer), blood in the urine (bladder cancer), or abnormal vaginal bleeding (endometrial or cervical cancer). Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.
        </p>

                <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3>Systemic Symptoms
            </h3>
        </b>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes. Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as cachexia.Some cancers, such as Hodgkin's disease, leukemias, and liver or kidney cancers, can cause a persistent fever.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as paraneoplastic syndromes. Common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, or hyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures.

                <p style="color:darkblue;" <h2>Metastasis</h2>
                </p>
        </b>
        <p style="color:green;">
            Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.[37] Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green;">
            The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones.

                </b>
            <p style="color:green;"> Laboratory tests, such as urine and blood tests, may help your doctor identify abnormalities that can be caused by cancer. For instance, in people with leukemia, a common blood test called complete blood count may reveal an unusual number or type of white blood cells.

            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <b>Imaging tests:</h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;">Imaging tests allow your doctor to examine your bones and internal organs in a noninvasive way. Imaging tests used in diagnosing cancer may include a computerized tomography (CT) scan, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, ultrasound and X-ray, among others.
            </p>

            <p style="color:green;">During a biopsy, your doctor collects a sample of cells for testing in the laboratory. There are several ways of collecting a sample. Which biopsy procedure is right for you depends on your type of cancer and its location. In most situations, a biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p style="color:green;">In the laboratory, doctors look at cell samples under the microscope. Normal cells look uniform, with similar sizes and orderly organization. Cancer cells look less orderly, with varying sizes and without apparent organization.

            <p style="color:green;">
                Once cancer is diagnosed, your doctor will work to determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Your doctor uses your cancer's stage to determine your treatment options and your chances for a cure.
            </p>
            <p style="color:green;">
                Staging tests and procedures may include imaging tests, such as bone scans or X-rays, to see if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

            <p style="color:green;">
                Cancer stages are indicated by the numbers 0 through 4, which are often written as Roman numerals 0 through IV. Higher numbers indicate a more-advanced cancer. For some types of cancer, cancer stage is indicated using letters or words.

                The treatment for cancer varies depending on the type and stage of cancer, as well as individual factors such as overall health and preferences. Here are some common treatment modalities used in cancer care:

                Surgery: Surgical intervention involves the removal of cancerous tumors or affected tissues. It is often the initial treatment for solid tumors and aims to eliminate localized cancer cells.
            </p>

            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3 <b>Radiation Therapy: </h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;">This treatment uses high-energy radiation (such as X-rays or protons) to target and destroy cancer cells. It can be delivered externally (external beam radiation) or internally (brachytherapy). Radiation therapy may be used as a primary treatment or in combination with other therapies.
            </p>

            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3 <b>Chemotherapy: </h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;">Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells or inhibit their growth. It can be administered orally or intravenously and may be given as an adjuvant therapy (after surgery or radiation) to eliminate any remaining cancer cells or as a primary treatment for cancers that are sensitive to chemotherapy.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3<b>Immunotherapy:</h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;"> Immunotherapy helps to stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. It includes various approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell transfer, and monoclonal antibodies.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3<b>Targeted Therapy:</h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;">Targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target cancer cells based on their genetic mutations or specific proteins. It aims to interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3<b>Hormone Therapy:</h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;">Hormone therapy is used for cancers that are hormone-sensitive, such as breast and prostate cancer. It involves blocking or inhibiting the effects of hormones that promote cancer growth.
            </p>

            <h3><b>
                    <p style="color:darkblue;" <h3<b>Stem Cell Transplant:</h3></b>
            <p style="color:green;"> Stem cell transplantation, also known as a bone marrow transplant, involves replacing diseased or damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells to help restore the body's ability to produce healthy blood cells.
            </p>
            <p style="color:green;">

                It's important to note that the choice of treatment depends on factors such as cancer type, stage, location, and individual considerations. Treatment plans are typically developed in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and other specialists.
            </p>
            <p style="color:green;">
                Additionally, supportive care is an essential part of cancer treatment and focuses on managing side effects, improving quality of life, and providing emotional and psychological support to patients and their families.

The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics.Environmental refers to any cause that is not inherited, such as lifestyle, economic, and behavioral factors and not merely pollution.

            <p style="color:green;">
                Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use (25–30%), diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of physical activity, and pollution. Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer, though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancer.
            </p>
            <p style="color:green;">
                It is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons.
            </p>
            <p style="color:green;">
                Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease, however factors that may have contributed to the development of cancer can be transmissible; such as oncoviruses like hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus and HIV.

                    Tobacco smoke for example, causes 90% of lung cancer. It also causes cancer in the larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas. Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide and about one in three in the developed world.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.

                    Diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths. In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths. A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country.

                    A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, causes liver cancer. Betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer. National differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet while colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country, often within one generation.

                    Worldwide, approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases. This proportion ranges from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world. Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also play a role.

                    Oncoviruses (viruses that can cause cancer) include human papillomavirus (cervical cancer), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma) and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias). Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma. Parasitic infections associated with cancer include Schistosoma haematobium (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis (cholangiocarcinoma).

                    Radiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer. Many non-melanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight. Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking. Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke. Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.</p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.

                    There is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment, probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies. Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, due to chronic inflammation. Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extra-intestinal malignancies.

                <p style="color:green;">
                    Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    Between 70% and 90% of common cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable. Greater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    Further, poverty could be considered as an indirect risk factor in human cancers. Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.
                </p>
                <p style="color:green;">
                    In 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths – or ~4.5 M deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years – were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI, according to a GBD systematic analysis.

                        Unlike diagnostic efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear. This may involve physical examination, blood or urine tests or medical imaging. Cancer screening is not available for many types of cancers. Even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone.

                        Universal screening or mass screening involves screening everyone. Selective screening identifies people who are at higher risk, such as people with a family history. Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening. These factors include:
